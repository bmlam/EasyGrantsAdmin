## Prepare

Run prepare.sql as a DBA user to create the a few thousend test objects 

One of the SQL statement produces the traditional grant statement which gets spooled into a SQL script ( I edited it to make it a PLSQL block ) so the SQLPLUS screen wont be flooded with feedback

Open two SQLPLUS session.

In session A: run this
In session B: run that
